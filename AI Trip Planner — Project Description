# AI Trip Planner — Project Description


AI Trip Planner is a modern, intelligent travel planning web application designed to simplify and enhance how users create, manage, and share their travel itineraries.
Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence technologies, the platform generates personalized trip plans tailored to user preferences, including interests, budgets, and travel dates.
Built as a full-stack solution with a React frontend and Node.js backend, AI Trip Planner uses MongoDB for data persistence and integrates multiple third-party APIs to deliver a rich, seamless experience.
The AI-powered itinerary generator utilizes OpenAI’s API to analyze user inputs and automatically suggest optimized daily activities, routes, and accommodations, helping travelers save time and
avoid planning overwhelm. The application also features real-time weather integration (via OpenWeatherMap) and interactive maps (using Google Maps API), enabling users to visualize their trip routes 
alongside up-to-date weather forecasts. Flight and hotel searches are incorporated through affiliate APIs, allowing users to find and book travel essentials without leaving the platform.
AI Trip Planner goes beyond standard travel apps by offering unique capabilities such as an AI chat assistant for personalized travel advice, mood-based activity suggestions, 
drag-and-drop itinerary calendar for easy trip editing, and budget management with live currency conversion. The platform supports group collaboration, letting friends and family co-create and 
share trip plans in real-time.Additional standout features include visa and travel document checks, offline PDF itinerary exports, and a marketplace for curated trip templates contributed by the community.
Monetization options such as premium subscriptions unlock advanced features and exclusive content. AI Trip Planner aims to fill gaps left by popular platforms like MakeMyTrip and Booking.com, 
focusing on personalized, AI-driven experiences combined with collaborative and offline capabilities to truly empower modern travelers.
